        <p>The happiest place on earth can be fun to plan for some, but others it can be stressful! Here are some personal tips on how to plan a trip to Disneyland quick and easy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>First, the best thing to do before booking the hotel and flights, is to find out the best time of year to go to Disney. Different times of the year have different events, shows, promotions, and even capacities of the parks. I personally like to plan around the weather. During the summer the park volume will be very high ad well as the temperatures. I've planned 3 trips to anahiem and my favorite time to travel there is in the spring time.

Generally the tickets will expire up to 2 years after the purchase, so that gives you plenty of time to plan your trip to the happiest place on earth.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now that we have our time of year and our ticket figures out, now it's time for the fun part...Finding the hotel! I like to stay at hotels that are a good walking distance from Disneyland/California Adventure. My favorite hotel to stay at is <a href='https://stovallsinn.com/'>Best Western Plus Stovall's Inn</a>. This hotel is perfect walking distance from Disney! It is right behind California adventure, so at night if you want to relax in the pool or hottub, you have a Perfect view of the fireworks and Mickeys fun wheel! The rooms were very spaceous and accomadating, with  </p>
